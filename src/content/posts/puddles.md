When it rains, and I’m driving, I try not to drive through puddles and splash mud on those around me. Truly, it’s my
only
wish that puddles didn’t exist. But they do. And sometimes I have to drive through them either because I have no other
choice or because I’m not mature enough to know my speed. The buildings are a blur sometimes, and the road is the only
thing I see, not knowing that there are those who are unwilling witnesses to my folly. Maybe the music is too loud to
ignore, and I’m enjoying the drive too much, but I don’t see it and I drive through one.

It splashes mud on them and
ruins their day, while I’m still unaware of the repercussions of my action. Sometimes though, they care enough to come
back and tell me. They don’t have to, they can curse my car and be on their way, but they don’t. Because they are good
humans. The only thing that I can do is apologize when this happens. I can’t undo the damage I have done, I wish I
could,
but I can’t. All I can do is hope that they forgive me. I never meant to drive in the puddle, but it happened.

I wish
there were none, but that’s not possible. Life has puddles sprinkled throughout as if the road blocks and the speed
breakers were not enough. I am not blaming it on life, its my job to watch out for them.
These things make you take stock of what you have and tell you to slow down. Life is not meant
for speeding through because you might drive through a puddle and affect someone you never meant to hurt.

Again, I never meant to drive through the puddles and I’m sorry for that.
