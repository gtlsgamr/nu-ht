I think this has been long overdue. I will be discontinuing the Mahabharat review series that I started more than two
years ago. Despite promising multiple times that I will keep going on, I have come to a realization that I won't be able
to. There are multiple reasons for that but the primary reason is that I do not have the time for it. If by some miracle
I do get the time for it, I can continue. Since I cannot predict when I will be able to continue with it, I won't be
putting an ETA on it.

I will also remove it from my primary navigation bar as well the home page. You can find it [here](/mahabharat), in case you want to
revisit the old reviews.
