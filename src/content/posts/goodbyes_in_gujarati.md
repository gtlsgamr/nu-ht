The word _goodbye_ according to the Oxford Dictionary originates as follows:

> late 16th century: contraction of_God be with you!_, with_good_substituted on the pattern of phrases such as_good
morning_

God be with you on this journey you are taking. I don’t know how you will fare, but _farewell_. These words are final.
They give closure.

My language doesn’t.

There is no final parting word in Gujarati. When we part, we say આવજો (aavjo) or હાલો મળ્યા(haalo malya). First one
means come soon and the second means we will meet soon. Gujarati language flat out refuses finality. All relations are
permanent, they may be stretched out across months, years or even lifetimes. But they are tied together by a _haalo
malya_ across space and time.

There is an ice cream shop near the place I live right now. I bought a home in another part of the town and will be
shifting there by the end of this month. The guy at the shop knows me well, I go there a lot. We have an unspoken
agreement of me bringing him _paan_ every visit. No preferential treatment, just some unspoken bond. So when I went
there today for what was probably the last time, I told him haalo malya and he said aavjo. Now this relationship was not
significant in the great scheme of things. It was one of the many thousands that a man makes in his lifetime. But there
was a melancholy tint in that aavjo. Maybe he doesn’t see it that way but I do.

Now I’ll have to find a new ice cream shop and become friends with the new staff until I move again.

Farewells are not fair, in my view. They strip you of all hope and leave you with longing beyond human capacity. You try
to be the bigger person and wish well for the departing, but deep down you want them to stay. For some reason you can’t
tell them that. When your language forbids you from experiencing this pain, it feels like a blessing. Until you actually
want to say goodbye.
