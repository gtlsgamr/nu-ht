Welcome, dear visitor, to my personal website!

Having a website is a matter of leaving a digital footprint, a way to express myself, and a platform to share my thoughts and creations with the world. This site is a reflection of who I am, what I do, and what I love. It's a space where I can be myself, explore my interests, and connect with like-minded individuals.  
I am Hitarth, a tech enthusiast from India. I'm passionate about creativity, storytelling, and technology, and this website is my nook on the internet to express that passion.

Back in 2016, I ventured into the world of digital art. It was a year of exploration and creativity, and the result is a collection of digital artwork that I'm quite proud of. You can check out my creations right [here](/artwork) on this site. Last but not least, I was the creator of [~tildevarsh](https://tildevarsh.in) _(now defunct)_, a vibrant online space where I used to spend a lot of my time. It was a wonderful community, and I'd forever cherish the things we did there.

So, take a look around, explore, and enjoy your stay. This is my corner of the internet, and I'm glad to share it with you.
