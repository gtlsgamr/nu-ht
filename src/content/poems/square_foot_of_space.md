Hopes and dreams    
and the troubles in between    
My infinite pride    
is worthless it seems.    
Boundless feats    
of extraordinary measure    
all of that trouble    
for a blink of pleasure    
Everyone I know    
and all that I will meet    
will never know    
my pathetic deceit    
I drive and I dance    
and I jump on my feet    
But I listen to songs    
which sing of defeat.    
It's been a while    
since I felt like a kid    
wrapped in a cocoon    
my heart under a lid    
I long too much    
for a loving embrace    
decades I will burn, 
for a square foot of space.
